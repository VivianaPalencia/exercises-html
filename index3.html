    As night falls on Hogsmeade village, “The Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle” shines brightly with an awe-inspiring spectacle that showcases the four houses of Hogwarts:<span><b><I>Gryffindor, </b></I></span> Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin and culminates with awesome beams of lights that fan into the night sky.
